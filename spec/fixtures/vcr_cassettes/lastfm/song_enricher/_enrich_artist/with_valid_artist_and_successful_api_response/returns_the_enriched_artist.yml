        Lancashire in 1960. With the line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney,  George
        Harrison, and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most popular and influential
        band of all time. The group was integral to the development of 1960s counterculture
        and popular music''s recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and
        1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music
        and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles
        ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers
        in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionized
        many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of
        the era''s youth and socio-cultural movements. \n\nLed by primary songwriters
        Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in
        Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe
        playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since
        1958, went through a succession of drummers, eventually settling with Pete
        Best in 1960, who played with them for two years before being replaced with
        then Rory Storm & The Hurricanes drummer Ringo Starr in 1962. Manager Brian
        Epstein molded them into a professional act and producer George Martin guided
        and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after
        their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into
        the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname
        \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band''s entourage
        sometimes given the informal title of \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964,
        the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of
        the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon
        made their film debut with A Hard Day''s Night (1964). From 1965 onwards,
        they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber
        Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper''s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967),
        and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the
        White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). In 1968, they founded Apple Corps,
        a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related
        to the band''s legacy. After the group''s break-up in 1970, all four members
        enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980,
        and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain
        musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time,
        with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record
        for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits on
        the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group was
        inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members
        were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped
        Billboard''s list of the all-time most successful artists on the Billboard
        Hot 100. The band received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy
        Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen
        Ivor Novello Awards. Time magazine named them among the 20th century''s 100
        most important people.\n\nFormer Rolling Stone associate editor Robert Greenfield
        compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints
        of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original
        \"... In the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary,
        more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described
        their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of African-American
        rock-and-roll with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance
        in popular music since the War\".\n\nThey not only sparked the British Invasion
        of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the
        1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much
        of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan
        Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee.
        The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from
        abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with
        UK culture.\n\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians
        worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles'' influence and enjoyed
        chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the
        beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York''s WABC
        radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking
        the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They
        helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded
        out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music
        video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American
        tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert
        history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step
        toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially
        their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on
        fashion.\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened
        to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began
        as the Beatlemania fad, the group''s popularity grew into what was seen as
        an embodiment of socio-cultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s
        counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and
        activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as
        women''s liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter
        Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the
        Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted
        effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\n\n\nOther
        commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception
        of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania
        period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the
        development of generational awareness. Referring to their appearance on the
        Ed Sullivan Show Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked
        the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped
        into the United States of 1964.\n\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon,
        McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).
        The Beatles won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the
        film Let It Be (1970). The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor
        Novello Awards, the Beatles have six Diamond albums, as well as 20 Multi-Platinum
        albums, 16 Platinum albums and six Gold albums in the US. In the UK, the Beatles
        have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and
        one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
        1988.\n\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than
        800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one
        albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million,
        than any other act. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Beatles as the most
        significant and influential rock music artists of the last 50 years. They
        ranked number one on Billboard magazine''s list of the all-time most successful
        Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart''s 50th
        anniversary. As of 2017, they hold the record for most number-one hits on
        the Billboard Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of
        America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US,
        more than any other artist. They were collectively included in Time magazine''s
        compilation of the 20th century''s 100 most influential people. In 2014, they
        received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThere are two holidays
        celebrated for the Beatles: Global Beatles Day on 25 June each year. On that
        date in 1967, the band performed \"All You Need Is Love\" on television. In
        2001, UNESCO created World Beatles Day on 16 January each year. This date
        has direct relation to the opening of The Cavern Club in 1957.\n\nFive asteroids,
        4147 Lennon, 4148 McCartney, 4149 Harrison, 4150 Starr and 8749 Beatles are
        named after the Beatles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles\">Read
